const items = [
  "1. The average domestic cat sleeps between 12 and 16 hours a day, making them one of the most sleep‑driven mammals on Earth.",
  "2. A cat’s whiskers are highly sensitive touch receptors that help it gauge whether it can fit through tight spaces; they are usually about as wide as the cat’s body.",
  "3. The oldest recorded cat in history lived to be 38 years old, a remarkable lifespan for a feline that surpassed the average of 15–20 years.",
  "4. Cats have a specialized collarbone (clavicle) that allows them to always land on their feet when they fall—a skill known as the righting reflex.",
  "5. The scent glands located at the base of a cat’s tail and on its cheeks allow cats to mark territory by rubbing against objects, leaving both chemical and visual cues.",
  "6. A cat’s heart beats about 70–120 times per minute, which is roughly twice the rate of an adult human heart at rest.",
  "7. The vocal range of a domestic cat spans over two octaves, from deep growls to high-pitched chirps that can mimic bird calls.",
  "8. Cats possess a unique “flicker fusion threshold” that lets them detect motion in very low light—an adaptation for nocturnal hunting.",
  "9. A cat’s tongue has tiny, backward‑pointing barbs made of keratin that help it groom and remove loose fur efficiently.",
  "10. The average cat can run at speeds up to 30 miles per hour (48 km/h) during short bursts, comparable to a human sprinter in terms of acceleration.",
  "11. Cats have a third eyelid called the nictitating membrane, which protects their eyes while still allowing them to see during sleep or when injured.",
  "12. The “purring” sound is produced by rapid contraction of the laryngeal muscles at about 25–150 vibrations per second, and it can also serve as a self‑healing mechanism.",
  "13. A cat’s sense of hearing extends up to 64 kHz, far beyond human hearing limits, allowing them to detect ultrasonic prey signals.",
  "14. The average domestic cat has around 30 teeth, including sharp incisors for biting and molars for grinding food.",
  "15. Cats have a highly developed “whisker fatigue” phenomenon; overstimulation of their whiskers can cause discomfort or stress, so they often avoid touching objects with too many surfaces.",
  "16. The genetic diversity among domestic cats is high enough that the average cat shares about 95% of its DNA with other felines, yet retains distinct behavioral traits.",
  "17. A cat’s bladder can hold approximately 1–2 milliliters per kilogram of body weight, which explains why they often need to urinate more frequently than dogs.",
  "18. The “catnip” plant (Nicotiana tabacum) contains a compound called nepetalactone that triggers a behavioral response in about 50–70% of cats, causing them to roll, purr, and become hyperactive.",
  "19. Cats have a specialized organ called the vomeronasal organ or Jacobson’s organ, located on the roof of their mouth, which detects pheromones for social communication.",
  "20. The average cat can detect a single drop of water in a bowl from over 10 feet away due to its acute sense of hearing and smell.",
  "21. A cat’s skin contains more hair follicles per square inch than any other mammal, contributing to their dense fur coat that provides insulation and camouflage.",
  "22. Cats are obligate carnivores; they require high levels of taurine—a sulfur‑containing amino acid found only in animal tissues—to maintain heart health and vision.",
  "23. The “cat’s eye” effect is a natural phenomenon where the cornea reflects light, creating a bright green or amber glow when illuminated from behind.",
  "24. A cat’s brain weighs about 30 grams, but its cerebral cortex occupies roughly 10% of its body weight, giving it advanced problem‑solving abilities relative to its size.",
  "25. The “Sphinx” breed is one of the few hairless cats in the world; they have a genetic mutation that reduces fur growth while retaining all typical feline behaviors.",
